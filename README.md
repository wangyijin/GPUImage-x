Idea from: [iOS GPUImage framework](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) and [Android GPUImage framework](https://github.com/CyberAgent/android-gpuimage)

The GPUImage-x framework is cross-platform (for both Android and iOS) library, which aims to have something similar to GPUImage that let you apply GPU-accelerated filters to images, live camera video. The greatest strength of the libray is that it enables you to **maintain your Android and iOS project with one library, as the core code of this framework is written in C++.**
